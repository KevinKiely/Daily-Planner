Quiz-Game-Project-4
Description
This project is a functioning quiz game about the capitals of different countries. It has the ability to keep score, a countdown timer, and a way to easily save your score to the highScores table using local storage. The point of this project was to familiarize myself with the use of local storage, timers, and for loops, and a variety of other skills related to Javascript.
